# User Cursor global object engine

Constantly predefined, lazy calculated and fully on stack abstract object under the global and unified controller.
Package represent an lightweight engine for developing custom user cursors for frontend.

> Fact that all usable and actual features are always represented within an entity interface is granted,
> every inderect access to any entity within this package does not grants stability and proper work.
> Actual module interface can always be found within this package or later in the `Docs` section.

Usage
-----

**Import** cursor controller
```ts 
import { UserCursor } from 'cursor-controller'
```

Cursor, as an UI element, is already predefined and 'lazy calculated' due to JS/TS features, only when it's used first time.

Cursor has inner render cycle, where it's state is can be dynamically changed. `Render` method call starts it.
To make cursor visible, call `Display` method

```ts
UserCursor.Render();
UserCursor.Display();
```

Now cursor is rendered on a screen, but you wount be able to see it, because now it's just a defaut styled div node.
Cursor behavior, apperience and etc is changed within `REFERENCE_CURSOR` method call. It recevies a callback, which can
accept a HTMLElement. Within this callback you can directly access a UserCursor node.

```ts
UserCursor.REFERENCE_CURSOR((e) => {
    e.className = 'my-cursor';
});
```

If method named with only uppercase leters, this means that this method can change its signature, naming, behavior and etc,
or its current realisation is not suitable at some moments, maybe.


Features
--------

- [x] Position serialisation

> Cursor will stay in the same place even after reloading

```ts
import { UserCursorController } from 'CursorController'
interface UserCursorController
```


#### Show cursor on a screen 
```ts
Display(customMountPoint?: HTMLElement): void
```
@param customMountPoint change default (document.body) node to mount cursor on
@returns void


#### Remove cursor from the screen
```ts
Remove(): void
```
@returns void


#### Start cursor inner rendering loop
```ts
Render(): void
```
Render loop is responsible for cursor inner logic processing,
which changes its state and UI.
@returns void


#### Stop cursor inner render loop
```ts
Freeze(): void
```
Render loop is responsible for cursor inner logic processing,
which changes its state and UI.
@returns void


#### Set shift between real user pointer and UserCursor UI positions
```ts
SetShift(xDifferencePX?: number, yDifferencePX?: number): void
```
How it works - for example user is holding his mouse pointer on a x: 10 and y: 20
coordinates. So, by default, cursor position wound be changed to x: 10 and y: 20,
but cursor width and height are, for example, 5px and 5px respectively. On a screen
it wound look like cursor triggers events when it's only his left upper corner hits a html node.

So to 'fix' that, you can set xDifferencePX and yDifferencePX. In this situatuation, after
you set this values to 5 and 5, cursor will look proper and trigger events when its center
hits a node.
@param xDifferencePX difference between user real pointer on a screen and a cursor ui position for X coordinate
@param yDifferencePX difference between user real pointer on a screen and a cursor ui position for Y coordinate
@returns void


#### Reference a user pointer node withing a callback
```ts
AccessCursorUI(accessCallback: (cursorUI: HTMLDivElement) => void): void
```
@returns a cursor node
